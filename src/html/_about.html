        DUSTLAND is a third-person looter-shooter. In the post-apocalyptic world, everyone has
        the only goal: to return alive
        after exploring the wasteland with as many valuable things as possible.
        40 years ago a scientific catastrophe inflicted untold damage to the world. Now the planet is suffering from the
        unbearable boiling heat and all living creatures have either mutated or lost their sanity

        A few lucky survivors found shelter in the unfinished seed vault called “Yanmei”. They
        hope to give new birth to the
        world by clearing it of monsters and anomalies. One of the most dangerous world regions is called DUSTLAND.
        Around two
        miles of hostile burnt ground. Ferocious sandstorms, recurrent anomalies and myriads of monsters… If mankind
        is
        destined
        to survive, people can’t but take up the challenge to clear this region.
